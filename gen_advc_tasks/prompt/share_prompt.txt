You will receive a webpage screenshot and textual annotation detecting the GUI components in this screenshot. 
The the first three lines of the textual annotation are the URL, title and description of the webpage, respectively, and the GUI component detections are listed below.
Each GUI detections are separated with a newline. Each line is represented by types, text, supplementary information and bounding box separated by comma, describing a specific HTML element visible in this webpage screenshot.  
The types, separated by whitespace, are enclosed in curly braces, and the text is enclosed in double quotes.
Supplementary information corresponds to the title or aria-label attribute of an HTML element.
Bounding box coordinates are represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2] with floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y.
The detection might not contain text or supplementary information, so the corresponding fields might be empty.
